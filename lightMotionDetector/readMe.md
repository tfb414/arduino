This project is designed to check if it is dark in the house and it detects motion it will hit my homeAssistantStatus project which will check if any lights are on and if not it will turn on some lights for me.

This relies on https://github.com/tfb414/homeAssistantStatus

Please note that I have changed one of the pins from 21 to 26
