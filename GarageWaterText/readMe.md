Included a photo of how the build is setup

To startup please bring in the secrets module with the keys

Functionality:
Currently when the water reaches a threshold it will send a text message to my phone alerting me of water in my garage

Next steps:
Solder the whole system to a pcd board and print a case for it to be deployed

Eventually I would like to use liPo batteries to let it be deployed without being plugged in
